## ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Do Not Use This Template for Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities using public GitHub issues.**

For security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature instead:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Fill out the private vulnerability report form

Alternatively, you can contact the maintainer directly through GitHub.

## Why Private Reporting?

- Protects users while the vulnerability is being fixed
- Allows for coordinated disclosure
- Prevents malicious exploitation
- Follows responsible disclosure practices

## What Qualifies as a Security Issue?

- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses
- Information disclosure issues
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation issues
- Any issue that could compromise user security

## For Non-Security Issues

If this is not a security vulnerability, please use one of these templates instead:
- [Bug Report](?template=bug_report.md) - for functional issues
- [Feature Request](?template=feature_request.md) - for new features

## Need Help?

If you're unsure whether an issue is security-related:
- When in doubt, use private reporting
- Contact the maintainer for guidance
- Review our [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)
